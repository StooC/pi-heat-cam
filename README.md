# Raspberry Pi using a Thermal Camera
Uses a [Pimoroni's MLX90640 Thermal Camera Breakout](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/mlx90640-thermal-camera-breakout?variant=12536948654163) (although other boards tend to have the same wiring with Raspberry Pi and [Pimoroni Display Hat Mini](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/display-hat-mini?variant=39496084717651).

Performance was between 4-5 fps using a Raspberry Pi 3B+

PyCharm was used to write the code which was then copied to the Pi.

# Libraries Used
- Display Hat Mini (https://github.com/pimoroni/displayhatmini-python)
- Adafruit's MLX 90640 (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MLX90640) although Pimoroni amoung others have there own versions too.

# Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Pimoroni and Adafruit for providing their software libraries.
